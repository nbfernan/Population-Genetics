## STRUCTURE GUI instructions (for MacOS)
How to use STRUCTURE GUI on Mac:

1. Launch STRUCTURE GUI from Applications
  Use GenAlEx to get STRUCTURE input data file 


2. Enter in the structure for the data file : 
	Number of individuals= XX
	Ploidy of data= 2
	Number of Loci= XX
	Missing data value= -99 (whatever number you used for missing data in your genotype files)

3. Check off: 
	Row of marker names
	Data file stores data for individuals in a single line 

4. Check off:
	Individual ID for each individual
	Putative population for each individual
	USEPOPINFO selection flag (GenAlEx automatically enters this into your data file)

5. Enter in data parameter set (tab from the main window): 
	a. Click “New…”
	b. While in the tab “Run length”: 
		Length of Burnin Period= 10000 (burnin is usually 10% of your MCMC reps)
		Number of MCMC Reps after Burnin= 10000 
	c. Click on the tab “Ancestry Model”
		Make sure the “Use Admixture Model is selected for and click “Advanced…”
			For my analyses, I did not select for any other options 
		Make sure “Infer ALPHA” is selected for and click “Advanced…”
			Enter the Initial ALPHA to be 0.5 (1/K)
			Select for a “Separate Alpha for each population” 
			De-select to “Use a Uniform Prior for ALPHA”
	d. Save your parameter set
		I usually name is something that has to do with the parameters (e.g., 		“burnin10k_mcmc100k_alpha0.5”
6. Enter in the Project tab (from main window):
	a. Select to start a job
	b. Select for that parameter set you just created (or former ones you created with this dataset already)
	c. Set K (at least 3 more values than what you anticipate)
	d. If you want to use a set value, manually expand the window so you can set the seed
	e. Enter number of iterations
